## Welcome

I think many blog themes are over designed, so I created this one. 

Just for using, not showing off.

## Nice Blog

A Simple Jekyll Blog Theme.

[Demo](http://gabriel-chen.github.io/Nice_Blog)

![index-page](https://i.imgur.com/BrmOMmv.png)

Introduce yourself in `About` page  :
![about-page](https://i.imgur.com/vRGFclV.png)

And you can turn on or off your skills tree in `_config.yml` :  
![skills-tree](https://i.imgur.com/ssSOj57.png)

Posts will be listed by years in `Archive` page:  
![archive-page](https://i.imgur.com/8bQZtkD.png)

Post will be listed by categories in `Category` page:  
![category-page](https://i.imgur.com/cRHuAWi.png)

Post will be listed by tags in `Tags` page:  
![tags-page](https://i.imgur.com/pnRdDD0.png)

You can put your `PGP` publickey in `Contact` page:  
![contact-page](https://i.imgur.com/8wHb5lX.png)

Now you have a `404` page and it will jump back to `index` page itself:  
![404-page](https://i.imgur.com/mtkM64q.png)

If you add `finshed: true` in your post header, then an `EOF` container will show under your post like this:  
<div class="eof"></div>

Or it will show `TBC`:   
<div class="tbc"></div>
